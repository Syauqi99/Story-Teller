We can choose the element
- ID: getElementByID
- Class: getElementsByClassName not quite the same as accessing class 
- tag: getElementsByTagName

We can also access its child
for example suppose an img has id image then
to access its source
getElementByID(image).src

We can change the element as well
for the inner text aka item inside the <> <>
x = getElementByID(image)

x.textContent = 'something'

we can also change the html between <>

x.innerHTML

we can also change style

x.style

Class Name will return a list of containing its child 
the method is the same 

Tag name works like class name but it choose based on tag
(h1, h2,p)

QuerySelector is convinient wa of choosing any element without
specifying it as class or id. However, it will only return single
value and can't return list like ClassName or tag 

to get list we can use QuerySelectorAll

Parent Node is the one higher on the tree 
sibling is the items that is equal on position and  parentnode

child Node will choose all of the childs given the parent 
Beware this also return any line break 
This return HTML Collection 

First child return any first element including line break 
First Element child however giving the first non line break item 
replace this with last will give the last element instead

NextSibling will give the next child but also include any line break 
use nextelementsbiling instead 

Previous will give the previous sibiling


//Create Element 

var newDiv = document.createElement('div');

new.className = 'hello' //add class 

//add id
newDiv.id = 'hello1' id 

//add attr 
newdic.setAttribute('title', 'Hello Div')

//add element inside the div 

var newDivText = document.createTextNode('Hello World')

// add text to div 
newDiv.appendChild(newDivText)

var container = document.querySelector('header .container')
var h1 = document.querySelector('header h1')

newDiv.style.fonstSize ='30px'

container.insertBefore(newdiv, h1)

to make some function triggered when clicked
var button = document.getElementByID('button').addEventListener('click', buttonclick)

function buttonClick(e){
    document.getElementByID('header-title').textContent = 'changed'
}

the function above is equivalent to 
if clicked{
    change header text to change 
}

we can also pass e onto the function 
e.target will give the element that is clicked
e.target.className will give the calss name as a string 
e.target.classList will give the class as a list
